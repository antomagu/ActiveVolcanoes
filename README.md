<h1>Active Volcanoes </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of an interactive dashboard that is simple to use and easy to understand, guiding the user to locate any volcano by country, showing its name, its location on a global map and giving us its tectonic configurations.
<br />

### Objectives:
The objective is to create an interactive board with information about the active volcanoes in the world by country, showing their location on a map, characteristics of the technical plate and last recorded eruption.

The most important indicators are: Name of the Volcano, Country, Configuration of the Tectonic Plate, Number of Volcanoes

<h2>The tools used were</h2>

- <b>MySQL</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Power BI</b>

<h2>Data transformation and Data preparation:</h2>   
Data was taken from Kaggel profiles with data available for use, in csv files,
Power Bi and Power Query were used for data cleaning

<h2>Conclusions</h2>  

- <b>The United States is the country with the most active volcanoes in the world</b> 

- <b>Russia is the country with the most volcanoes in Europe followed by Iceland</b>

- <b>Indonesia and Japan are those that concentrate the largest amount in Asia</b>
 
- <b>In Latin America Chile is the country with the most volcanoes followed by Mexico</b>

- <b>The largest number of active volcanoes are found in the Pacific Ring of Fire, with a significant number of volcanoes in East Africa</b>
  
- <b>Tectonic characteristics can vary in type, it does not depend on the geographical location of a volcano</b>
